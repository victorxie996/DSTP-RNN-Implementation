Introduction
-------
This is one preliminary implementation example for the paper:《[DSTP-RNN: A Dual-Stage Wwo-Phase attention-based Recurrent Neural Network for long-term and multivariate time series prediction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419307997?via%3Dihub)》. I extended the code from [DA-RNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02971) model, but given that I am basically copying the code from [Zhenye-Na](https://github.com/Zhenye-Na/DA-RNN), the copyright probably belongs to him.

Results

Here are some simple experiment results.
